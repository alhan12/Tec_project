# Tecnologico de Monterrey Project
This project is part of  a test for a Research Programmer and Data Scientist position at the 
Decision Sciences Research Center at Tecnologico de Monterrey. 

The project consist of 5 questions about the CO2 emission throughout the world and study the impact of many varaibles.
## Package
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn wbgapi scikit-learn plotly -U kaleido


## Question 1
This program downloads the data using the World Bank Data Library considering many economic and environmental indicators.

Then clean and substitute the NaN-values using a k nearest neighbor algorithm.<br>
The last part shows the correlation between the economy and environmental variables.<br>
This ipython returns the csv file of the data obtained, and the correletion between the variables.<br>

## Question 2
This program make a Linear regression assuming that CO2 Emissions are the dependent variable, split the data into training and testing set.<br>
Supossed that there is an increase in GDP and applies and analyses the results.<br>
And returns the information into a interactives graph comparing the projected and current emission.

## Question 3
This program adds more data into the csv file using the World Bank Data Library considering new environmental indicators.<br>
Again, clean the data and add NaN values using the k nearest neighbor algorithm to sustite the values.<br>
Now, since the EV adoption was not avaible in the WBD, I used a similar variable (renewable energy percentage) since there is a negative correlation respect to CO2 emissions.<br>
I used and train a Linear regression and use it to predict what would happen to CO2 emissions if the renewable energy percentage increase. <br>
The program returns the interactive plots<br>

Since there is a new condition, the emissions should be always positive or at least zero, but many prediction does't hold this condition, so I cleaned the results and ploted only the countries what Linear regressions is valid.

## Question 4
This program classifies the data through a binabary variable, uses a Random Tree classificator. It traing the algorithm with the data that we have collected in the question 3.
Here is the importance of features in CO2 emissions reduction.

## Question 5

This final part makes the assumption if a country where the renewable energy percentage is less than 10% and it increase the percentage by 50%, what would happen.<br>
To predict the probability we use the classifier trained in the last problem, and the results are plotted in the interactive plot
![](https://github.com/alhan12/Tec_project/blob/main/e.png)
The points blue represent the countries where is a high likelihood to decrease their CO2 emissions while the red points represent the countries where is not possible.
So the plot shows that almost the half of the countries could decrease their CO2 emissions.
